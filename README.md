# Data Science Tutorial

To try out the Python examples here on your own, sign up for an account at [wakari.io](https://wakari.io). If you're feeling ambitious, you can also run it on your own computer using [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Both MATLAB and Stata can be downloaded from Pitt's [Software Download Service](https://my.pitt.edu/portal/server.pt/community/software_downloads/872).

## Getting data

One can get data from many different sources and in a variety of formats. The real GDP data here (`data/GDPC1.csv`) is from [FRED](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/). It is in CSV format (comma separated variables), which is just plain text separated by commas.

## Working with data

You'll find some examples here demonstrating how to work with data. This includes loading, transforming, and plotting it. Currently the examples include:

- `time_series.py`: a pure Python example (requires `pandas` package)
- `time_series.ipynb`: a Python notebook example
- `time_series.m`: a MATLAB example
- `time_series.do`: a Stata example
