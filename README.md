# Data Science Tutorial

To download Python and run these notebooks on your own computer, head on over to the [anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

There are three sessions for the tutorial:

1. Intro to Python (Python Indoctrination) - `Session_1.ipynb`: How to run and use Python. Covers language basics, numerical operations with `numpy`, visualization with `matplotlib`, parsing HTML with `BeautifulSoup`, and more.
2. Working with Data (How to replace Stata) - `Session_2.ipynb`: Data collection and manipulation. Basic statistics and econometrics with `pandas` and `statsmodels` libraries. Machine learning with `tensorflow`.
3. Solving Models (How to replace MATLAB) - `Session_3.ipynb`: Optimization and equation solving with `scipy`. Symbolic operations and approximation. Interfacing with lower level languages and `Cython`. Practical estimation.
